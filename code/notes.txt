Build problems:

(codeql/infer): grok fails to build because commit in not in a branch
(codeql/infer): gdal takes forever and there is a mistake at the end 
(codeql/infer): libxml2 does not build properly since there are syntax errors in the code
(codeql/infer): readstat cannot be built because of function declaration (changing cflags was impossibleerror: a function declaration without a prototype is deprecated in all versions of C [-Werror,-Wstrict-prototypes), /project/src/readstat_bits.h:10:29, 
(codeql/infer): usrsctplib is the same as above
(infer): harfbuzz with ninja cant be built by infer
