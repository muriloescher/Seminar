Change format to 16:9, download from tum website

Took a little bit too much in the outline, skim through

Change approach to methodology, evaluation to results

Static testing has a lot of fps (assumed), dynamic testing no
we dont want to spend too much time and not have many fps
the dream is that static testing checks everything quickly and has not many fps

following report structure is not the best

present vision, we dont want to execute, we dont wanna have fps, we dont wanna need to check
we want to automate

ditch introduction and present big vision

explain the dream, big picture, attract people

put mininum amount of words, people and title
citing is important

making a diagram of the combination of sast tools would
split related work into 3 slides, make diagram for all

related work isnt the main topic, just a mean to get to the actual problem

make titles more teatrical


make different diagrams for the slides

5 make diagram horizontal, put logo of infer and codeql, also svf, also chatgpt logo
step-by-step animations

6 change bugoss dataset header, ground truth data (type, bic), box with files inside

7 codeql can also find memory-related issues, put logos of the tools

8 change bytecode for bitcode everywhere, changing font from digraph into similar to text in the
slide, draw by myself in power point

9 make diagram prompt+files -> chatgpt -> labels

10 make clear that vulns detected were flagged (51 vulns reported), context

12
Important:
ANALYSIS NEEDS TO BE DONE FOR FUNCTIONS WITHOUT CONTEXT
Come up with false positive reduction rate, analyze all functions and see what llm says

13
change takeaway depending on fp reduction rate, talk about ground truth

add vuln. amount table 1 from report as extra resource

eliminate outline if time does not allow
