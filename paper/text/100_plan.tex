\section{Plan}
\label{sec:plan}
The idea of this project is to use RAG, consisting of CVE reports and SAST tools, to enhance a LLM's ability to perform vulnerability detection.
The focus is going to be on reducing false positives for memory related vulnerabilites.

Using this dataset \url{https://github.com/ARISE-Handong/BugOss}, the pipeline will be as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Run CodeQL on dataset
    \item Get related CVE reports based on the output from CodeQL
    \item Merge both information as RAG ressource
    \item Use Gemini's API to send this info, along with the vulnerable code to the LLM
    \item Get LLM response through API
    \item Save response in a table?
\end{enumerate}

The data then will be evaluated as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The false positive rate will be calculated for both CodeQL and the LLM
    \item The \#vuln detected must be taken into account, otherwise FP would be 0 for 0 vulns
\end{enumerate}

Would using another SAST tool with a voting system (both must detect the vuln. for it to be sent to the llm) be useful?
